# A preliminary API to interact with Unity cloud build
This is a preliminary API which allows you to easily build scripts that interact with Unity Cloud build and which still compile and run locally. Locally, this API will
provide mock implementations. In the cloud, it will interact with the real thing.

This is currently under a "all rights reserved" license until we decide IF and WHEN and under which license we want to release it.

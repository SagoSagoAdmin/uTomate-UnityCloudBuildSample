uTomate demo version
====================

Thank you for downloading the uTomate demo version. This demo version has the full feature set of the full version
however we imposed some limitations on the demo, which should still allow you to test uTomate fully before buying it.

The limitations are:

- You can only have 2 automation plans in your project. If you have more than this, you will not be able to run
  plans until you're back to 2.
- An automation plan can only contain 5 entries. All entries can be added as long as you have 5 or less of them in a 
  single plan. It's also not possible to run plans containing more entries which have been created with the full version.
- We don't support migrating from the demo version to the full version. While migration might work seamlessly we don't
  test it and we don't guarantee that this works. This shouldn't be much of a problem though with the limitations in
  place.
- You cannot rename or move the "uTomate Demo" and "Chili4U folders". This is possible in the full version though.
